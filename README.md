# Coronavirus Recovery Prediction

###### This is a **Machine Learning project** focused on predicting whether a person will recover from coronavirus symptoms or not based on pre-defined symptoms and demographic information. The dataset used in this project contains daily-level data on the number of affected cases, deaths, and recoveries from the 2019 novel coronavirus, and we aim to use this data to design classifiers to predict the outcome for new patients.

## Overview

The **Coronavirus Recovery Prediction** project aims to predict whether a person will recover from coronavirus symptoms or not, based on a set of demographic features and symptoms. The dataset includes information such as the country of residence, age group, gender, and the presence of specific symptoms, as well as whether the person visited Wuhan, China or not. By utilizing several supervised learning algorithms, the goal is to predict the binary outcome (death/recovered) for new patients admitted to the hospital.

The data is time-series, with daily cumulative counts starting from January 22, 2020. This dataset has been pre-cleaned and pre-processed to make it suitable for model training. Your task is to design and optimize multiple classifiers, test their performance, and select the best model for predicting whether a new patient will recover or not.

## Dataset

The **Coronavirus Recovery Prediction** project focuses on designing classifiers that predict whether a patient has recovered from coronavirus or not based on a variety of features. The dataset includes demographic data, symptoms, and other relevant health information.

The classification task involves predicting whether the outcome is "death" (1) or "recovered" (0) based on the following features:

- Country, Location, Age, Gender
- Symptoms, Time Before Symptoms Appear
- Whether the person visited Wuhan or is from Wuhan.

Multiple classifiers will be used to design predictive models, and the performance of these classifiers will be compared using various metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC/AUC curves.

## Features

The dataset contains the following major variables that impact whether a person will recover from coronavirus:

1. **Country**: The country where the person resides.
2. **Location**: The specific part of the country.
3. **Age**: Age group classification based on WHO's age group standards.
4. **Gender**: The gender of the individual (Male or Female).
5. **Visited_Wuhan**: Whether the person has visited Wuhan, China.
6. **From_Wuhan**: Whether the person is from Wuhan, China.
7. **Symptoms**: There are six fields representing different families of symptoms.
8. **Time_before_symptoms_appear**: Time duration before symptoms appear.
9. **Result**: The result (1 = death, 0 = recovered).

The dataset has already been cleaned and pre-processed, making it ready for model training. You will need to divide the data into three partitions: training, validation, and testing.

## Models Used

This project employs several machine learning models to predict the recovery outcome for a patient:

### 1. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**

- **Type**: Instance-based learning algorithm.
- **Use Case**: Classifying whether a person will recover or not based on proximity to other similar cases.

### 2. **Logistic Regression**

- **Type**: Linear model for binary classification.
- **Use Case**: Predicting the probability of recovery or death based on input features.

### 3. **Na√Øve Bayes**

- **Type**: Probabilistic model based on Bayes' theorem.
- **Use Case**: Classifying recovery outcome based on symptom patterns.

### 4. **Decision Trees**

- **Type**: Tree-based model for classification.
- **Use Case**: Splitting the dataset into branches based on symptom and demographic features to classify outcome.

### 5. **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**

- **Type**: Classification model that works well for high-dimensional spaces.
- **Use Case**: Used to find the optimal hyperplane for separating recovery and death cases.

## Evaluation Metrics

The performance of each classifier will be evaluated using the following metrics:

- **Precision**: The proportion of positive identifications that were actually correct.
- **Recall**: The proportion of actual positives that were correctly identified.
- **F1-Score**: The weighted average of precision and recall.
- **ROC/AUC**: The Receiver Operating Characteristic curve and Area Under the Curve, used to evaluate the trade-off between true positive rate and false positive rate.

## Conclusion

The **Coronavirus Recovery Prediction** project uses various machine learning models to predict whether an individual will recover from coronavirus based on their symptoms and demographic information. By evaluating and optimizing these models, the project aims to develop a highly accurate classifier that can assist healthcare providers in assessing patient recovery outcomes.
